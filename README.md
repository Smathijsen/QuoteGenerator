# QuoteGenerator

> Vue.js Quote Generator

This application fetches random quotes from <http://quotes.stormconsultancy.co.uk/apiâ€‹>

A page refresh will result in a new quote being shown. 

The ```SocialMedia.vue ``` component uses ```vue-social-sharing ``` to create the links to the different social media networks. 

The quote is included into the message of each social media platform.

It uses [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) to style the buttons.
